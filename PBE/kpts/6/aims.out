  Calculation of forces was not defined in control.in. No forces will be calculated.
  Geometry relaxation not requested: no relaxation will be performed.
 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable
 * scf convergence criteria. However, this led some users to employ criteria
 * that led to extremely long run times, e.g., for simple relaxation.
 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.
 * You may still wish to check if this setting is too tight or too loose for your needs.
 * Based on n_atoms and forces and force-correction status, FHI-aims chose sc_accuracy_rho =  0.800000E-05 .

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -4.00698001 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99981384
  | K-point:      91 at    0.500000    0.500000    0.833333 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -3.97982235 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.91750438
  | K-point:      18 at    0.000000    0.666667    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.02715767 eV between HOMO at k-point 91 and LUMO at k-point 18
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.15335391 eV for k_point 91 at    0.500000    0.500000    0.833333 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -4.56040151 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -4.57232513 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.26407235

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.04923290 eV between HOMO at k-point 89 and LUMO at k-point 83
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.

  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -4.71577253 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -4.71393568 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.05122079 eV between HOMO at k-point 89 and LUMO at k-point 83
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -4.68551590 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.05642917 eV between HOMO at k-point 90 and LUMO at k-point 66
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.

  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -4.66843962 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -4.66712116 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -4.71603153 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.83345595

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.05438380 eV between HOMO at k-point 90 and LUMO at k-point 66
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.

  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -4.66814194 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -4.71752167 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.83748706

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.05494741 eV between HOMO at k-point 90 and LUMO at k-point 57
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.

  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -4.66787017 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -4.66785034 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -4.71725624 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.83770967

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.05491044 eV between HOMO at k-point 90 and LUMO at k-point 57
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -4.66785126 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.05492054 eV between HOMO at k-point 90 and LUMO at k-point 57

  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -4.71726708 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.83778773
  | K-point:      90 at    0.500000    0.500000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -4.66234754 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.87627797
  | K-point:      57 at    0.333333    0.333333    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.05491953 eV between HOMO at k-point 90 and LUMO at k-point 57
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.16516879 eV for k_point 87 at    0.500000    0.333333    0.833333 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -4.66785199 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :       -1040675.078421995 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :       -1040675.079128039 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -22.938250497 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

 * A warning was issued further up regarding the accuracy of onsite integrals.
   An integral with a negative eigenvalue was among the flagged integrals.
   In most standard situations, this warning is probably harmless.
   If needed, this can be verified by adjusting the radial_multiplier flag.

          Partial memory accounting:
          | Residual value for overall tracked memory usage across tasks:     0.000000 MB (should be 0.000000 MB)
          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:       39.570 MB (on task 0 after allocating wave)
          |   Maximum:       39.570 MB (on task 0 after allocating wave)
          |   Average:       39.570 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:       26.318 MB (KS_eigenvector_complex on task 0)
          |   Maximum:       26.318 MB (KS_eigenvector_complex on task 0)
          |   Average:       26.318 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
